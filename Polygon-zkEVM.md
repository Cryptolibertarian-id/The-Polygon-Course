# Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)

Zero Knowledge proofs are a way to prove that you know something, without revealing what you know or how. In a cryptographic setup, this means that someone needs to prove they know something (**prover**) and someone else needs to verify that it’s true (**verifier**).

# Polygon zkEVM



The basic approach to scaling Ethereum with ZK proofs is to build a ZK rollup, a Layer 2 protocol which “rolls up” a large batch of transactions and proves all of them to the Ethereum network with a single ZK validity proof.  The potential for a ZK rollup to scale Ethereum is obvious: One transaction replaces many, increasing throughput, saving on fees, reducing latency, etc.

Polygon zkEVM is the first zero-knowledge (ZK) scaling solution that’s fully compatible with Ethereum. So basically, Polygon zkEVM is Ethereum, but with ZK scalability. You can deploy any Ethereum smart contract to Polygon zkEVM because its EVM-equivalence.  Polygon zkEVM is new zk-rollup that provides Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence (opcode-level compatibility)

Polygon zkEVM was built by Polygon, but it’s for everyone who wants a cheaper, faster way to use Ethereum without sacrificing security or decentralization. Polygon zkEVM is permissionless–anyone can use it. It’s also open-source, meaning you can trust the code, rather than trusting them. 

Below are the some of the features of Polygon zkEVM

- Ethereum-equivalence: all smart contracts, wallets, tools, etc work on zkEVM seamlessly.
- Ethereum security
- ZKP-powered scalability, orders of magnitude higher throughput than L1.

Polygon zkEVM is a Layer Two (L2) scaling solution for Ethereum that leverages the scaling power of zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs while maintaining Ethereum-compatibility. Developers and users on Polygon zkEVM can use the same code, tooling, apps, etc that they use on Ethereum, but with much higher throughput and lower fees.

Developers will deploy their existing contracts to the zkEVM, and users can deposit assets from Ethereum and transact off-chain. These transactions are grouped into batches with a zero-knowledge proof proving the validity of each transaction. This ensures that the operators of the zkEVM can’t steal user funds, so we can say that it inherits the security of Ethereum L1. Polygon zkEVM offers compatibility and scalability without compromise.
