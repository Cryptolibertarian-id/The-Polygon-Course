The basic approach to scaling Ethereum with ZK proofs is to build a ZK rollup, a Layer 2 protocol which “rolls up” a large batch of transactions and proves all of them to the Ethereum network with a single ZK validity proof.  The potential for a ZK rollup to scale Ethereum is obvious: One transaction replaces many, increasing throughput, saving on fees, reducing latency, etc.

Polygon zkEVM is Ethereum, but with ZK scalability. You can deploy any Ethereum smart contract to Polygon zkEVM because its EVM-equivalence. 

Polygon zkEVM was built by Polygon, but it’s for everyone who wants a cheaper, faster way to use Ethereum without sacrificing security or decentralization. Polygon zkEVM is permissionless–anyone can use it. It’s also open-source, meaning you can trust the code, rather than trusting us.
